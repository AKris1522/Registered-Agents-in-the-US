  <h2>1. The Main Organizations They Work Through</h2>

  <p>Registered agent companies do not lobby openly under their own brand. Instead, they work through influential legal and administrative groups, including:</p>

  <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse;">
    <thead>
      <tr><th>Organization</th><th>Description</th><th>Who Participates</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>International Association of Commercial Administrators (IACA)</td><td>Professional association of state business filing offices (Secretaries of State divisions)</td><td>Filing officers, CT, CSC, NRAI, Cogency Global, Capitol Services</td></tr>
      <tr><td>American Bar Association (ABA) – Business Law Section</td><td>Drafts corporate laws (e.g., Model Business Corporation Act)</td><td>Corporate lawyers, registered agent legal advisors, lobbying firms</td></tr>
      <tr><td>National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS)</td><td>Nonprofit group for sitting Secretaries of State</td><td>Secretaries of State, indirect RA influence through sponsors</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Uniform Law Commission (ULC)</td><td>Drafts uniform laws (like UCC, MoRAA)</td><td>Lawyers, academics, RA company advisors</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>2. The Strategy Step-by-Step</h2>

  <h3>Step 1: Identify Inefficiencies</h3>
  <p>Large RA companies monitor state filing systems for delays, burdens, or missing Commercial Registered Agent (CRA) privileges.</p>

  <h3>Step 2: Draft “Model Legislation”</h3>
  <p>Through the ULC and ABA, they help draft laws like the Model Registered Agents Act (MoRAA), introducing ideas such as commercial RA status and centralized service of process rules.</p>

  <h3>Step 3: Soft Lobbying Through Trade Groups</h3>
  <p>They use IACA presentations, ABA comment periods, and published whitepapers to "educate" Secretaries of State about the benefits.</p>

  <h3>Step 4: Legislative Push</h3>
  <p>Once support is built, SOS offices or business-friendly legislators sponsor and pass the reforms into state law.</p>

  <h2>3. Real-World Example: Model Registered Agents Act (MoRAA)</h2>

  <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse;">
    <thead>
      <tr><th>Element Introduced</th><th>Benefit to Registered Agents</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>Commercial Registered Agent Status</td><td>Batch updates; no individual filing needed per client</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Automatic Consent to Appointment</td><td>No separate acceptance needed for every entity</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Bulk Resignation Rights</td><td>Mass resignation allowed instead of entity-by-entity resignation</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Standardized Service of Process Rules</td><td>Uniform lawsuit acceptance across multiple states</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>Without MoRAA and similar model laws, Registered Agents would face chaotic, varied compliance systems across all 50 states, increasing administrative costs and legal risk.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>4. Important Note</h2>

  <p>While powerful, this strategy is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Completely legal</li>
    <li>Conducted through normal legislative and administrative channels</li>
    <li>Framed as modernization and efficiency improvements for businesses</li>
  </ul>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Influence Flow Model</h2>

  <p>Registered Agent Companies → Trade Groups (ABA, IACA) → Model Law Drafts → Secretary of State Awareness Campaigns → Legislative Sponsorship → Statewide Adoption of Reforms</p>
